# Unreleased

This is a personal fork of neoai.nvim.
I've re-written a lot and not yet finished it ðŸ˜…

It will eventually have:
- A programmable API
- A persistent history that you can interact with
  - Open and close the window and the chat will stay there
  - Load up previous conversations*
  - Respond to previous messages*
  - Navigate your tree of responses*
- Customisable prompts you can select in a dialog*
- The same features from neoai.nvim: injection, chat, customizable chatgpt settings
- Support for ollama?*

* = still to do

In summary, don't use this yet
